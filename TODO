[todo] Rethink itemLayouts in cards-view. I'm thinking that maybe they should be set to default values up front, then modified as time goes on. No more clearing (as you see in performGridLayout).

[todo] Interesting comment:

  On the deck side - one thing that I'm dying for is a collection organizer...
  i want to be able to tell the site what sets I have - and then be able to figure
  out which decks I can build concurrently - ie flag decks as "currently constructed" -
  and then be able to filter / sort your other decks based on how much swapping would
  be necessary to build them.


COST TO BREAK NOTES
* Deus X and Sharpshooter have to work in both directions
* Variable strength ICE (Curtain Wall, Hadrian's Wall*, Ice Wall*, Salvage*, Draco*)
* Variable subroutines (NEXT Bronze, Ireress, Salvage*, Swarm*, Tyrant*, Woodcutter*)
* Sort by title or credits

RESPONSIVE NOTES
  iPhone  - zoom: 0.24
  Nexus 4 - zoom: 0.
  LG Optimus One 320x480

SIDE PROJECT
  Modernizr for performance characteristics. Maybe built with hooks so you can be constantly
  monitoring the live application.

  Characteristics to test for:
  * Scrolling
  * Image scale

IDEA FOR RESPONSIVE DESIGNS
  It seems like determining responsive breakpoints is often about determining when wrapping occurs, and replacing a
  control with a smaller representation.

  Seems like annotating HTML and generating the breakpoint variables would be an interesting project.
