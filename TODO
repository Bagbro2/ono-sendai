[todo] Collapsed mode for card groups
[todo] Hotkeys
[todo] Add calculated max for filters
[todo] Make it clear that moving back to the general filter will remove filters
[todo] Screensaver with random flavor text
[todo] Fix grunt-angular-templates
[todo] Ditch the $q promises in nr-cards-view. They slow down the UI with all their ticking
[todo] Jinteki/Haas-Bioroid special deck URLs
[todo] humans.txt -- add it!
[todo] Excluded general controls should explain through a tooltip why they're disabled
[todo] Rewrite sidebar to include the logo. That way we can start playing around with collapses for smaller screens
[todo] Rethink itemLayouts in cards-view. I'm thinking that maybe they should be set to default values up front, then modified as time goes on. No more clearing (as you see in performGridLayout).
[todo] Rename "filter" to "queryArgs" across the board
[todo] Randomized deck generation (draft decks), along with a couple special identity print outs
[todo] For ICE/breakers -- cost to break calculator
[todo] Scrolling on the card view

SIDE PROJECT
  Modernizr for performance characteristics. Maybe built with hooks so you can be constantly
  monitoring the live application.

  Characteristics to test for:
  * Scrolling
  * Image scale
