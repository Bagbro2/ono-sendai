TODOs
  * Collapsed mode for card groups
  * Indicate which filter group is active
  * Move corp/runner to transform bar (need better name for that, btw)
  * Hotkeys
  * Zoom
  * Focus last selected value on dropdowns (may require rewrite)
  * Add runner card filters
  * Add max to numeric filter
  * Make it clear that moving back to the general filter will remove filters
  * Card search in top right, keyword filter in general filters

SIDE PROJECT
  Modernizr for performance characteristics. Maybe built with hooks so you can be constantly
  monitoring the live application.

  Characteristics to test for
  * Scrolling
  * Image scale
