TODOs
  * Collapsed mode for card groups
  * Indicate which filter group is active
  * Move corp/runner to transform bar (need better name for that, btw)
  * Hotkeys
  * Zoom
  * Focus last selected value on dropdowns (may require rewrite)
  * Add runner card filters
  * Add max to numeric filter
  * Make it clear that moving back to the general filter will remove filters

Angular Questions
