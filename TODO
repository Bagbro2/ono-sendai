TODOs
  * Collapsed mode for card groups
  * Indicate which filter group is active
  * Hotkeys
  * Focus last selected value on dropdowns (may require rewrite)
  * Add calculated max for filters
  * Make it clear that moving back to the general filter will remove filters
  * Screensaver with random flavor text
  * Fix grunt-angular-templates
  * Ditch the $q promises in nr-cards-view. They slow down the UI with all their ticking
  * Jinteki/Haas-Bioroid special deck URLs
  * Why does enter switch to corp?
  * humans.txt -- add it!
  * Excluded general controls should explain through a tooltip why they're disabled
  * Rewrite sidebar to include the logo. That way we can start playing around with collapses for smaller screens
  * Rethink itemLayouts in cards-view. I'm thinking that maybe they should be set to default values up front, then
    modified as time goes on. No more clearing (as you see in performGridLayout).
  * Hoist keyboard handling for the detail view to the body or something, and figure out what to do when dealing
    with input controls.
  * Rename "filter" to "queryArgs" across the board
  * Randomized deck generation (draft decks), along with a couple special identity print outs
  * For ICE/breakers -- cost to break calculator

SIDE PROJECT
  Modernizr for performance characteristics. Maybe built with hooks so you can be constantly
  monitoring the live application.

  Characteristics to test for
  * Scrolling
  * Image scale
