TODOs
  * Collapsed mode for card groups
  * Indicate which filter group is active
  * Move corp/runner to subnav
  * Hotkeys
  * Zoom
  * Focus last selected value on dropdowns (may require rewrite)
  * Add calculated max for filters
  * Make it clear that moving back to the general filter will remove filters
  * Screensaver with random flavor text
  * Fix grunt-angular-templates
  * UI should not delay on filter changes
  * Ditch the $q promises in nr-cards-view. They slow down the UI with all their ticking
  * Jinteki/Haas-Bioroid special deck URLs
  * Why does enter switch to corp?
  * humans.txt -- add it!
  * Excluded general controls should explain through a tooltip why they're disabled
  * Rewrite sidebar to include the logo. That way we can start playing around with collapses for smaller screens

SIDE PROJECT
  Modernizr for performance characteristics. Maybe built with hooks so you can be constantly
  monitoring the live application.

  Characteristics to test for
  * Scrolling
  * Image scale
