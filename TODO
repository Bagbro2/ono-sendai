[todo] Collapsed mode for card groups
[todo] Hotkeys
[todo] Add calculated max for filters
[todo] Make it clear that moving back to the general filter will remove filters (or not -- color change made this better)
[todo] Screensaver with random flavor text
[todo] Ditch the $q promises in nr-cards-view. They slow down the UI with all their ticking
[todo] Jinteki/Haas-Bioroid special deck URLs
[todo] humans.txt -- add it!
[todo] Excluded general controls should explain through a tooltip why they're disabled
[todo] Rewrite sidebar to include the logo. That way we can start playing around with collapses for smaller screens
[todo] Rethink itemLayouts in cards-view. I'm thinking that maybe they should be set to default values up front, then modified as time goes on. No more clearing (as you see in performGridLayout).
[todo] Rename "filter" to "queryArgs" across the board
[todo] Randomized deck generation (draft decks), along with a couple special identity print outs
[todo] Scrolling on the card view
[todo] Cost to break calculator filter should have a tooltip to tell you that you can filter in various ways
[fix]  Work out a better way of counting subs -- Check out sensei as an example
[todo] Look into what this means (http://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/1s5gu4/i_made_a_spreadsheet_of_probabilities_to_have_x/cdu7hpf)

RESPONSIVE NOTES
  iPhone  - zoom: 0.24
  Nexus 4 - zoom: 0.
  LG Optimus One 320x480

SIDE PROJECT
  Modernizr for performance characteristics. Maybe built with hooks so you can be constantly
  monitoring the live application.

  Characteristics to test for:
  * Scrolling
  * Image scale

IDEA FOR RESPONSIVE DESIGNS
  It seems like determining responsive breakpoints is often about determining when wrapping occurs, and replacing a
  control with a smaller representation.

  Seems like annotating HTML and generating the breakpoint variables would be an interesting project.
